    <h4>A refreshing drink</h4>
    
    <p>Perfect balance of sweet and tangy with that refreshing vibe to it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>8 whole lemons</li>
        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        <li>Ice Cubes (<em>Optional</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Zest your lemon</li>
        <li>Boil 1 cup of water, and mix with your sugar</li>
        <li>Toss in lemon zest, and stir continously until sugar dissolves. This is your lemon-flavored syrup.</li>
        <li>Once dissolved, pour your syrup into a container, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>While you're waiting for your syrup to cool, slice and juice your lemons. </li>
